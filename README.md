## Project Structure

The application follows a structured component-based architecture:

```
src/
├── components/       # Reusable UI components
│   ├── ui/           # shadcn UI components
│   └── ...           # Custom components
├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks
├── lib/              # Utility libraries
├── pages/            # Page components
├── types/            # TypeScript type definitions
└── utils/            # Utility functions
```

## Key Components

### Authentication Flow

The application uses Supabase authentication and protects routes using the `ProtectedRoute` component in `App.tsx`:

```tsx
const ProtectedRoute = ({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) => {
  const { user, isLoading } = useAuth();
  
  if (isLoading) return null;
  
  if (!user) {
    return <Navigate to="/login" />;
  }
  
  return <>{children}</>;
};
```

### Goal Management

Goals are managed through several key components:

1. **NewGoalForm**: Creates new goals with titles, descriptions, and timeframes
2. **GoalCard**: Displays goal information with progress indicators
3. **GoalDetail**: Shows detailed goal information and related tasks
4. **RoadmapView**: Visualizes the AI-generated roadmap for a goal
5. **TaskList**: Manages tasks associated with a goal

### AI Integration

The application leverages AI for two primary features:

1. **Roadmap Generation**: When creating a new goal, the application uses the `generateRoadmap` function to create a personalized action plan
2. **Goal Suggestions**: The unique `AIGoalSuggestions` component offers pre-defined goals with roadmaps that users can add with one click

### Data Flow

1. User creates or selects a goal
2. The system generates a roadmap using AI
3. Tasks are created based on the roadmap
4. Progress is tracked as tasks are completed
5. Dashboard displays overall progress across all goals

## Core Workflows
